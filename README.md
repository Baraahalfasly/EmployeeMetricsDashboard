This code utilizes Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn to create and analyze data related to work hours and salaries of several workers. It first creates a manual dataset containing names, ages, cities, and salaries of the workers, and then generates random data for work hours. After that, the data is saved to CSV and Excel files, in addition to calculating basic statistics and saving them to a text file.

The code also includes steps for plotting charts that display the work hours for each worker, with the work hour values shown above each bar, providing a clear overview of the work information. The resulting images are organized within an output folder, making them easily accessible later. This code aims to facilitate data analysis and visualization.
